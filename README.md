## Overview

The aim of this project was to increase equality and fairness in the workplace, by reducing exploitation. Employers would enter details (e.g., how much the company paid all the workers) into their specified form, and workers would enter details (e.g., how much they expected to be paid) into their forms.

Discrepancies in data would be recorded by the government. Discrepancies above a threshold (10%) would lead to government investigation, to find out whether the company or workers were entering false data.
